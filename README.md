# multi-mode-client
Threaded server-client file/data transfer program, now with multiple modes of operation. 
Not completely proud of this, but threading now works with at least a few threads for all methods, so I'm proud of that (considering all the work it took to get there). 

Program was made without version control and later uploaded to github, hence the commits' useless names and low frequency.
It was then ported from TAMU enterprise Github, to Github proper.
